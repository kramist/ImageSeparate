# Image Cleaning Utility

## Overview
This utility is designed to assist in the process of cleaning old photographs by automatically detecting and removing dark spots, which are typically caused by age or damage to the physical medium. It uses a simple color thresholding technique to identify spots based on RGB values.

## Features
- **Spot Detection**: Identifies dark spots within an image by comparing pixel RGB values to a defined threshold.
- **Image Cleaning**: Generates a cleaned version of the image without the detected spots.
- **Spot Coordination**: Saves the coordinates of the detected spots to a text file for further analysis or manual editing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow library

## Installation
Before running the script, ensure that you have Python installed on your system and the required Pillow library. You can install Pillow using the following pip command:
```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## Usage
1. Place the image you want to clean in the same directory as the script or specify the path to the image in the script.
2. Adjust the `threshold` variable in the script to match the darkness of the spots you wish to remove.
3. Run the script with Python:
```bash
python image_cleaning_script.py
```
4. The script will produce two files:
   - A cleaned version of the image with the spots removed.
   - A text file (`dirty_pixels.txt`) containing the coordinates of the detected spots.

## How It Works
The script processes an image in the following steps:
- Loads the image and converts it to an RGBA format to manage transparency.
- Iterates over each pixel, comparing its RGB value to the threshold.
- If a pixel is darker than the threshold, it's marked as a spot.
- Generates a new image with the spots removed and another image with only the spots.
- Saves the coordinates of these spots to a text file.

## Customization
You can modify the `threshold` value in the script to better match the specific conditions of your image. Lower values will detect darker spots, while higher values can capture lighter spots.
